# Dr. Nut - Rebrand FIP

Dr. Nut is a carbonated beverage that provides a unique blend of flavors and refreshing taste. To rebrand Dr. Nut, the packaging and logo could be redesigned to create a fresh, modern look that better aligns with the brand's target audience.

This repository contains:

● A fully functional responsive website with some dynamic content
(HTML/CSS/JS/Image files, etc,).

●  A fully functional prototype of mobile and desktop Adobe XD wireframes and designs.

●  A brand document/style guide.

●  An infographic commercial (.mp4).

●  A mock-up of the packaging and package template.
